# Algorithmic Complexity (Big O Notation) 
Algorithmic complexity helps us measure **how efficient** an algorithm is in terms of **time** and **space** as input size increases.  


## Types of Complexity
🔹 Time Complexity – Measures how long an algorithm takes to run based on input size (n).

🔹 Space Complexity – Measures how much memory an algorithm uses.

## Big O Notation – Measuring Time Complexity
Big O notation describes the **worst-case performance** of an algorithm.  

| Complexity  | Name                | Example Use Case |
|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **O(1)**   | Constant Time       | Accessing an array element `arr[i]` |
| **O(log n)** | Logarithmic Time   | Binary search 🔍 |
| **O(n)**   | Linear Time         | Looping through an array |
| **O(n log n)** | Log-Linear Time  | Merge Sort, Quick Sort |
| **O(n²)**  | Quadratic Time      | Nested loops (e.g., Bubble Sort) |
| **O(2ⁿ)**  | Exponential Time    | Recursion in Fibonacci |
| **O(n!)**  | Factorial Time      | Brute-force permutations |
